Step 1:

the current is calculated by combining the resistors in one equivalent resistor with a value of 5700ohms in this case.
ohms law is used to calculate this current with the provided cvoltage of (5V). 5V / 5700ohms = 0.88mA.

The voltage divider is used to calculate the voltage on the first resistor(R1). In this case it is R1/ R1 + R2 * U => 1000/5700 * 5 = 0.87V. This is the first voltage drop from 5V.
the same is done to get the value of the second resistor(R2) in this case it is R2/ R1 + R2 * U => 4700/5700 * 5 = 4.12V. This is the second voltage drop on the second node. 

step 2:

circuit has been built.
the measured voltage on the first and second ressitor is as follows : Ur1 = 0.899V and Ur2 = 4.219V.
the measured voltage provided by the arduino is: 5.112V 
so these measurements are plauible.
the measured current is around 0.89mA. This also checks out with the calculations provided in step 1.

step 3:
if the analog0 returns total voltage then it would be a simple voltage drop equation. So 5.112V from the first node - the voltage drop on Ur1. So 5.112V - 0.899V = 4.213V.
that is the theory.

step 4: 
Using the follow program, we first found the value of the analog and we convert this into a voltage and display this.
The previous theory was not completely correct, we initially thought iit would return a voltage immedietly but it returns an analog value with range of 0 - 1023 that needs to be converted.
