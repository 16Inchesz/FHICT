- pick a resistor out of box
- determine the value of resistor (read,measure,calculate)
- determine power through resistor (calculate I and P using R and U)
- what is max power the component can take.

questions that need to be answered.
- how can we determine max power of component can take.
- check if color scheme and reading from multimeter are decently correct.


things we noticed
- we had a short circuit at some point. you would notice this
 in the form of heat.
