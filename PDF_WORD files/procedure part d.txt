step 1:

why is r1 required?
what is minimal value r1?
what should r1 be at normal daytime?


#1
if you dont have a resistor or the resistor value of R1 is too low, then you run the risk of constructing a short circuit ti the power source when there is a lot of light on the ldr. this is dangerous and can cause problems.

#2
Imax of the LDR in this case is: 75mA.
assuming that the LDR has a value of 0ohms, you have a circuit then with just one resistor. The voltage is 5v and the max current is 75mA. Using ohms law we dtermine that the minimal value that we need for resistor R1 = 66.67ohms.

#3
for now it can be determined that at normal daylight the voltage on the LDR should be an offset of 2.5V. With this is mind the voltage drop on both resistors must be equal if the VCC is 5V. so the voltage drop on R1 = 5V - 2.5V = 2.5V. We know that a maximum amount of current can go through the ldr, this being 75mA. so we calculate R1 by using ohms law. Ur1 / Imax => 2.5 / 75mA = 33.33Ohms. This is the value that R1 should be in daytime. 

#4
we noticed that when the ldr was inside the circuit we could not measure it, it wouldn't give a value. but independtly  it gives off a certain value. on top of which we realized that when we shone some light on it, the resistance of it went lower and lower. (anomalie)

the measured resistance on the LDR in daylight is: 161.7ohms.
the measured resistance on the LDR in synthetic light is:
1981ohms.
this makes sense if compared to the graph in the datasheet checks out. 

our resistor is a 329.3ohms.
however when in a circuit with the ldr in daylight the value of the resistor becomes: 299.6ohms.

step 2:
the ranges we found in this circuit were as follows

In the dark the voltage on the LDR is: 4.983V
in well lit areas the voltage on the LDR is: 4.383V
and in sunlight the voltage on the LDR is: 3.979V

no the 2.5V offset would not be optimal, an optimal offset would be a well lit area in daylight. In our case we measured a value of 4.383V. A good offset would be 4.4V.

if the Uldr has an offset of 4.4 then the voltage on the R1 should be 5V - 4.4 = 0.6V.
so using ohms law r1 has the following vaoue: U / Imax => 0.6 / 75mA = 8ohms.
