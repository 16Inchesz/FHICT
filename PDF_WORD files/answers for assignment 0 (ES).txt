- determining the value of resistance
	- color scheme
	we start of by checking the color on the resistance for 		measurements. we have the colors from, left to right,
	yellow, blue, red and gold.
	in this 4 band resistor,the first and second band are 	values. there is no 	third band in this case. the 3rd band
	is the multiplier and the last band is the tolerance.
	in our case it comes to a value of 4.6kOhms with a 5% 	tolerance.
	
	- measuring
	we first stuck the resistor in a breadboard. and we turned 	on the 	multimeter and stuck both the meter cables in the 	correct (com and 	VohmhzC) and put each needle on seperate 	ends.
	the measurement we got was around : 4.672. this is indeed accurate because 	5% of 4600 is 230ohms. so the resistor 	needs to be within the range of 	4830ohms and 4370ohms.

	- calculate 
	we first start by connecting the battery to some mtm wires 	and 	measuring the voltage using the multimeter. this results 	in a value 	of around 8.4 volts. this is accurate enough 		because we are using 	a 9 volt battery. we then connect the 		battery in the circuit we 	made consisting of the powersource (battery) and the 4.6kOhms resistor. 		a side note, we tried 	to measure the current through the battery with the 		multimeter. this resulted in a short circuit. This small 	occurance 		made it that the battery was slightly drained and 	had some heat on it. 	on top of this , our multimeter had a 	slight fault with a fuse. this 			caused that we couldn't get 	any milli/micro amp values. 
	once all of this has been solved, we measured the current in 	the circuit. 	this value was around. 183mA with this we can 	aproximetaliy calculate the 		resistor using ohms law. this is 	done by multiplying the current and 		the voltage. so 8.4 / 0.00183 = 4590.1 .this is accurate because it is 		within the 5% tolerance of the resistor.

	- determining the power through the resistor.
	this is done using the power formula of: P = U * I.
	common procedure would be to calculate I using U and R, 	which are 		known values. this is done before connecting to 	the power source. I 		= U / R, 8.4V / 4672ohm = 0.0018A. this 		value is from our 		measured voltage and resistance. in an 	ideal situation where the voltage is 	9 volts and resistor is 	4600, the equation would be as follows: 9.0V 	/ 4600ohm = 		0.00196A. 
	
	using the power equation we determine that the power in our 				calculated circuit is as follows: 8.4V * 0.0018A =  0.01512 	watts.
	
	- determing the max power it can take.
	our resistor is a 1/4 resistor according to the maximum 	power 		specifications in the slides. meaning the current can 	be calculated using 				the formula: 1/4 = 8.4 * I. I would be 0.029A.
