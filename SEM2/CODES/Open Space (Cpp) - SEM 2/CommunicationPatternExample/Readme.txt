EXAMPLE COMMUNICATION PATTERNS

This is an example of designing two associated communication patterns for two Arduinos communicating over a serial connection.
One pattern is for the sender side and the other pattern is for the receiver side. The designs are documented in a technical report. 
See the 'docs' folder. The designs have been implemented in separate projects. Both projects use the same library files. 
See 'lib' in the projects. Please, read the technical report, study the designs and their implementations. 

These communication patterns are essential for developing reliable and robust communication protocols. All design and implementation 
techniques in this example can be very helpful for developing high quality software with state diagrams in your industrial project.
