Hello there. My name is Johnson Domacasse. I study at Fontys.
I chose the ICT study. I chose the technology program.
I chose this program because I really like seeing my creation come to life.
I am hoping to be done with this study, three years from now.
After that I want to get a good job working for a good company.
